    "# Week 4 Implementation: Minimal RLM for Needle-in-Haystack Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a minimal working RLM system that reproduces the RLM-minimal loop: injecting context into a Python REPL, generating Python queries, and retrieving correct results."
   ]

    "## Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "We aim to build and optimize a Recursive Language Model (RLM), where a base LLM interacts with an external Python REPL that holds long or complex context. The goal is effective recursive editing: the model must use Python tool calls (searching, transforming, filtering) to retrieve or generate correct answers on tasks where normal long-context prompting fails due to context degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: Real tasks like log analysis, large-file parsing, and multi-step code tasks require repeated access to external information rather than a single forward pass through the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RLM Concept\n",
    "An RLM (REPL-augmented Language Model) integrates a Python REPL with a base LLM. The model issues REPL actions to search, filter, or transform external context stored in the REPL, enabling access to arbitrarily long information beyond the model's context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Needle Retrieval Task\n",
    "Embed a `KEY=VALUE` pair (the \"needle\") in a long random text (the \"haystack\"). The agent must retrieve the value using Python REPL actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Requirements\n",
    "- **Synthetic needle-in-haystack data**: Generated dynamically using `generate_task()` function\n",
    "- **Format**: `KEY=VALUE` pairs embedded in random filler text\n",
    "- **Haystack size**: Configurable (default 15 sentences, ~500-1000 characters)\n",
    "- **Needle format**: Alphanumeric values (e.g., `SECRET_CODE=XYZ12345ABC`)\n",
    "- **Edge cases**: Missing needles (num_needles=0) and multiple needles (num_needles>1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Metrics\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly retrieved needles (exact match required)\n",
    "- **REPL Steps**: Number of REPL interactions required (lower is better)\n",
    "- **Runtime**: Time per episode in seconds (efficiency measure)\n",
    "- **Token usage**: (Future metric when LLM is integrated)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- **Maximum REPL steps**: Prevents infinite loops (default: 1 for deterministic, 10 max)\n",
    "- **Safe execution environment**: No dangerous imports (os, sys, subprocess), file access, or long runtime (5-second timeout)\n",
    "- **Synthetic data only**: Week 4 uses generated tasks, not real-world data"

    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Episode Definition\n",
    "An episode is a sequence of actions $a_1, a_2, ..., a_T$ taken by the agent, culminating in a final answer $y$. Each action $a_t$ represents a REPL command executed to search, filter, or transform the external context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "**Goal**: Maximize expected reward $E[R | \\pi]$ under policy $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = C - \\sum_{t=1}^{T} S_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $C$ = correctness score: 1 if final answer $y$ matches ground truth, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- $S_t$ = step cost: small penalty per REPL action (encourages efficiency)\n",
    "- $T$ = number of REPL steps taken\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**: The reward is computed in `EvaluationFramework.run_evaluation()` where `is_correct` maps to $C$ and `repl_steps` maps to $\\sum S_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- **Maximum steps**: $T \\leq T_{max}$ (default $T_{max} = 10$)\n",
    "- **Safety**: All actions must pass sandbox restrictions (no dangerous imports, file access, or long runtime)\n",
    "- **Timeout**: Each REPL action limited to 5 seconds execution time"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This section implements the core RLM components: safe REPL executor, task generator, agent framework, and evaluation system. The implementation follows a minimal approach focusing on the deterministic baseline to demonstrate the REPL loop working end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Design Decisions\n",
    "1. **Safe execution first**: Implemented `safe_execute_code` with comprehensive security (whitelisted builtins, blocked imports, timeout)\n",
    "2. **Deterministic baseline**: Start with regex-based agent to validate the pipeline before LLM integration\n",
    "3. **Modular architecture**: Agent base class allows easy extension to LLM-driven agents\n",
    "4. **Comprehensive logging**: Transcripts capture all REPL interactions for debugging and analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "### Known Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Limitations**:\n",
    "- No LLM-generated tool actions yet (only deterministic baseline)\n",
    "- Tasks are simple single-step retrieval (no multi-step reasoning required)\n",
    "- Training loop not implemented (no learning from experience)\n",
    "- No token counting (will be added when LLM is integrated)\n",
    "- Limited error recovery (agent doesn't retry on failure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**:\n",
    "- Question format is fixed: \"What is the value of {KEY}?\"\n",
    "- Needle values are alphanumeric (no special characters)\n",
    "- Haystack fits in memory (not tested with very large contexts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debug/Test Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging Approaches**:\n",
    "1. **Transcript inspection**: Check `transcript` field in results to see all REPL interactions\n",
    "2. **Error messages**: `stderr` in `ExecResult` shows execution failures\n",
    "3. **Step-by-step execution**: Run single episodes manually to isolate issues\n",
    "4. **Edge case testing**: Test missing needles, multiple needles, long haystacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Strategy**:\n",
    "1. **Unit tests**: Test `generate_task()` with different parameters\n",
    "2. **Integration tests**: Run full episodes and verify correctness\n",
    "3. **Edge case tests**: Missing needles, multiple needles, malformed questions\n",
    "4. **Performance tests**: Measure runtime and REPL steps across different haystack sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate (Week 5)**:\n",
    "1. Integrate a small local or API LLM to generate Python actions\n",
    "2. Test LLM-generated code with safe_execute_code\n",
    "3. Add retry logic for failed executions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-term (Weeks 6-8)**:\n",
    "1. Add tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., filter then search)\n",
    "2. Implement basic imitation-learning loop using successful trajectories\n",
    "3. Add token counting and optimize for efficiency\n",
    "4. Scale to larger haystacks and more complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term (Weeks 9-15)**:\n",
    "1. Implement RL-style optimization (reward-weighted updates)\n",
    "2. Add more sophisticated reward shaping\n",
    "3. Evaluate on real-world tasks (log parsing, code analysis)\n",
    "4. Compare with baseline long-context prompting"
